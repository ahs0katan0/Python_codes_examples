# Python_codes_examples
These are examples of my Python codes that I have developed for longer projects for my courses.

The first example is a code I wrote without Loops and conditionals but my first set of functions.
The file name is Average_of_5_scores_minus_Outliers.py

The second example is a code I wrote for Compound Data Structures. It creates a dictionary, and within the same function creates a list for the value with the maximum count. The file name is Compound_data_struc.py
